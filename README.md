# Discord-Question-Bot

- using discord.js
- i'm currently figuring out how to register slash commands with discord
- ask perry for bot tokens/ env stuff etc
- mongodb for database storage?

- slash command to register new questions on db (will probably need multiple instances for different servers?)
- slash command to set question channel/ question time
- pulls a question from db every day
